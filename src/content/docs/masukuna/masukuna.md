This video is an artifact of applied sociolinguistics and intercultural pedagogy, illustrating the expansion of the Quechua linguistic domain into science education and community-based knowledge production.

---
The project, framed as an "Adventure of the Night Detectives" and led by Amanda Vilchez biologist from La Molina University, is highly relevant to studies on language maintenance and revitalization due to the following themes:

## Outcomes

The project generated concrete outcomes at different levels

### Linguistic Agency and Identity:

- The collaboration between academic researchers and the Lanchu community demonstrates the assertion of local and indigenous agency in defining scientific relevance. The use of Quechua as the primary language of instruction validates local knowledge systems and reinforces the link between the language and communal identity.

### Language in Educational Policy (EIB):
Domain Expansion and Corpus Development: The video explicitly uses Quechua (as evidenced by the title "Llanchupi Masokuna" and the narrative fragments, including greetings and community names) to communicate complex scientific concepts related to nature observation. This process is crucial for the modernization and functional expansion of the Quechua linguistic corpus, positioning it as a viable language for academic and scientific discourse, not merely domestic use.

## Impact

The impact of this video lies in its ability to inspire, educate, and offer a practical roadmap for linking linguistic revitalization with scientific engagement and digital media.
