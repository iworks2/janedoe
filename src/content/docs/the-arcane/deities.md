This project was developed in partnership with the cultural exchange project between South America and the rural agricultural transition towards environmental protection, involving more than 50 interviews and local visits.

## Description

This interactive Genially presentation documents the "Caravane Vidéo" initiative, a collaborative project led by CCFD-Terre Solidaire to tackle the systemic causes of global hunger and inequality.

Framed as a tool for mobilization and awareness, the project moves beyond conventional documentary formats. It actively highlights the resilience, organizational capacity, and agroecological solutions developed by partner communities in the Global South (including areas with high indigenous linguistic vitality, like parts of the Andes, although not explicitly named in the Genially).

For a sociolinguist, the Caravan is significant because it represents an intercultural communicative platform. It translates complex social and environmental justice issues across linguistic and geographic borders, demonstrating the challenge and necessity of ensuring that the voices, linguistic frames, and local epistemologies of marginalized communities are preserved and accurately represented in international advocacy efforts.

## Outcomes

The project, when analyzed through a sociolinguistic lens, yields the following outcomes:

### Linguistic Mediation and Translation: 

- It necessitates sophisticated linguistic brokerage to faithfully convey complex concepts (e.g., global economic mechanisms, agroecology science) between local indigenous languages (like Quechua, if the project engages Andean partners) and international advocacy languages (French, Spanish, etc.).

### Challenging Epistemic Injustice: 

- By centering the visual and narrative agency of local partners, the Caravan acts against epistemic injustice. It affirms that the knowledge and lived experiences of communities, often expressed in their native tongue, are authoritative and central to developing global solutions.

### Digital and Visual Literacy: 

- The use of video and interactive digital platforms (like Genially) to document and share information contributes to the expansion of digital and visual literacy domains within community-based sociolinguistic practices.

As a native Quechua speaker, I view this project as a crucial case study in how international solidarity can intentionally or incidentally influence the prestige and communicative scope of local languages through media production and knowledge dissemination.
