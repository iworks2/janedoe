This project proposes the creation of an interactive book, both physical and digital,
containing 10 Andean stories collected from native Quechua-speaking communities.
The initiative aims to consolidate cultural exchange between Cornell University students
and native Quechua speakers, while also producing didactic materials that strengthen
language learning in an engaging, culturally grounded manner.

## Outcomes

The project generated concrete outcomes at different levels

### For the Field of Language Teaching:

- Creation of an innovative teaching resource that integrates storytelling, language practice, and cultural awareness.
- A scalable methodology that can be adapted to other languages, especially less commonly taught or endangered languages, where the cultural approach is very significant

### For Native Communities:

- Recognition of local native or heritage speakers as cultural ambassadors through the contest.
- Tangible contribution to the preservation of oral traditions in a format accessible to a wider audience.

### Transferability and Scalability:

- The pedagogical model, story collection, integration of linguistic activities and creation of interactive resources can be replicated for other levels of Quechua or for other minority languages.
- The methodology of intercultural exchange and project-based learning may inspire faculty across the Department of Romance Studies and other language programs.
- It was very Important to point out over the diverse varieties of one language, that is the reason that this initial project was created to cover the Quechua Collao - Puno, Peru variety and it is totally possible to proceed with more varieties.
